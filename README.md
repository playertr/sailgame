# sailgame
A little game to sail a little boat around.

**Try me on Github Pages [here](https://playertr.github.io/sailgame/)!**

# Inspiration
Uses the color scheme from [webgl-wind](https://github.com/mapbox/webgl-wind) (ISC License).

Based on starter code from [wind-js](https://github.com/Esri/wind-js) (MIT License).

Extends these by integrating an OpenLayers scrollable and adding a little boat to sail around.

# Gameplay
Use the arrow keys to turn the boat left and right. You go slowly upwind and quickly downwind, according to the boat's [polar diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_diagram_(sailing)).
